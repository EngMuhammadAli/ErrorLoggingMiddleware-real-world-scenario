The advantage of using error logging middleware, as demonstrated in your example, is primarily about centralizing error handling and logging logic in one place. Here are the key benefits:

Centralized Error Handling: The error logging middleware (ErrorLoggingMiddleware in your case) intercepts exceptions thrown during request processing. This ensures that all unhandled exceptions are caught before they reach the global error handler or exception page middleware (DeveloperExceptionPageMiddleware).

Logging: It logs detailed information about the exception, such as the exception message, stack trace, and request path (context.Request.Path). This information is crucial for diagnosing and debugging issues in production environments.

Separation of Concerns: By separating error handling and logging from the rest of your application's business logic, you adhere to the principle of separation of concerns. This makes your application cleaner and easier to maintain.

Consistency: It ensures consistent error handling across different parts of your application. Instead of scattering error handling code throughout various controllers and services, the middleware ensures that all exceptions follow a uniform logging and handling pattern.

Immediate Feedback: Developers and administrators get immediate feedback on errors as they occur in the application, enabling quicker responses to issues and reducing downtime.

In your example, the middleware catches any unhandled exceptions (InvalidOperationException in this case) and logs them using _logger.LogError(ex, ...) before re-throwing the exception. This approach ensures that the exception is logged even if it's ultimately handled by another part of the application.

By implementing error logging middleware, you enhance the robustness and maintainability of your ASP.NET Core application, making it easier to monitor, debug, and troubleshoot errors in production environments.
